# Week 3: Tiling Patterns Part 1

## About

In this session, we will work through Investigation 1 (*Moving, Turning and Stamping*) and Investigation 2 (*Repeating and Alternating Patterns*) from Module 1: Tiling Patterns, from the ScratchMaths curriculum materials.

The theme of Module 1: Tiling Patterns is repeating patterns. The activities in this Module involve creating patterns by moving, running and “stamping” shapes in Scratch.
As mentioned in the teacher materials for Module 1, the Tiling Patterns Module’s activities could also be linked to other learning areas. 
For example,these activities could link to the Creative Arts, as the geometrical patterns students create may be similar to those that are commonly present in art in different cultures and movements, such as [Islamic Art](https://www.google.com/search?q=islamic+art&safe=off&client=firefox-b-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimyoaO2pbbAhUBn5QKHXZGC6QQ_AUICigB&biw=1680&bih=837){:target="_blank"}.

The **computational concepts** covered in this module include *Sequences* and *Loops*. The mathematical concepts that are covered in these Investigations include *Symmetry*, *Angles*, *Patterns*, *Co-ordinates*, and *Positive and Negative Numbers*.
