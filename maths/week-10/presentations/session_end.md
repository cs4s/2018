# Week 10: Create another Lesson Plan

- Plan another lesson that involves the teaching of *Coding* alongside *Mathematics*
- You can complete the template that we have created
- Fill in the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF8FOvcyFbrPOKi_zm2fsv-VCJ5WC4tlxQB5xZu7eSv0wK1A/viewform) or complete and email the Word template on the Week 10 session page

# Lesson Plan Template

- [Google Form Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF8FOvcyFbrPOKi_zm2fsv-VCJ5WC4tlxQB5xZu7eSv0wK1A/viewform)
- The idea of this task is to help you plan out how you could teach Coding in your classes, alongside Mathematics
- You can be brief in your answers to the questions (for example, 2-3 sentences) but you can also write as much as you would like
- Any questions?
