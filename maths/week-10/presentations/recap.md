# Last Session

- Started working through ScratchMaths Module 5: *Exploring Mathematical Relationships*
- Worked through *Investigation 1: Polygon Fireworks*
- *User Input* and *Variables*
- Making a Sprite *ask* a question and using the *answer*
- *Drawing polygons*, *interior and exterior angles* and calculating tower heights

# Exploring Mathematical Relationships Part 1

- Before we start today's activities, I will go through a few things I didn't get a chance to go over last session
- End of *Investigation 1: Polygon Fireworks*
- Drawing tower with different *side lengths* and different *number of floors*
- Calculating the total height of the tower

# Exploring Mathematical Relationships Part 2

- In this session, we will work through *Investigation 2: Mathematically Similar Rectangles*
- Involves exploring proportionality and ratios
- Demonstrate the difference between the *set variable to* and *change variable by* blocks
- If we have time, we will have a look at *Investigation 3: Grid World: For Exploring Similarity*
