# Week 10: Exploring Mathematical Relationships Part 2

## About

In this session, we will work through *Investigation 2* (*Mathematically Similar Rectangles*) from *Module 5: Exploring Mathematical Relationships*, from the ScratchMaths Curriculum Materials.

As this session is the last session in the *Coding in Stage 3: ScratchMaths* program, we will also ask you to complete an online survey. 
This survey is similar to the one that we asked you to complete in the Week 1 session but it also has some extra questions where you can give us feedback about the program.
We will also let you know about *Stage 2* of the project and tell you how you can be involved with the interviews and/or observations in Term 3 and 4.

The focus of the ScratchMaths Module 5 is the exploration of mathematical relationships with Scratch, including proportionality and ratios.
As mentioned in the Module 5 Teacher Materials, the *Exploring Mathematical Relationships* activities could also be linked to other learning areas.
For example, in Investigation 1 you will have the opportunity to create images that include backdrops of city skylines, which could be linked to lessons and concepts within the HSIE: Geography syllabus. 

This Module also introduces *variables*, which is another **computational concept** and builds on the concepts you have learned in previous sessions, such as *Sequences*, *Loops* and *Operators*.
The activities in the *Exploring Mathematical Relationships* Module also build on mathematical concepts from previous weeks' activities, including *co-ordinates*, *angles*, *division* and *multiplication*.

### Homework

For this week's homework task, we would like you to create another plan for a lesson that involves teaching Coding and Mathematics, like you did last week.
We have created a template for you to complete for this task which has sections for the different parts of the lesson.
If you would like to, you can use ideas and activities from the ScratchMaths resources in your lesson plan.

To complete this task, you can choose to either: 1) fill in the Google form linked below or 2) download the Word template and email that to Daniel when you have finished filling it in. 
If you complete the Google form, you will not have to send Daniel an email because, once the form is completed, he will be sent an email automatically.

If you use a different template for your lessons and would prefer to use that for this task, that is ok. 
In that case, please send an email with the completed template to Daniel.
