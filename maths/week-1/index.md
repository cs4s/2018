# Week 1: An Introduction to Scratch

## About

In this session, we will give an overview of the entire professional learning program. We will also explain the research project that this program is a part of.

In the session’s activities, you will find out what *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* are and how these skills are related to the Stage 3 curriculum. You will learn about Scratch, the free coding language and community that is commonly used when teaching computational thinking in K-6. You will create a program that combines three essential **computational concepts**: *sequences*, *loops* and *conditionals*.

| 3.4.2: Select and/or create and use a range of resources, including ICT, to engage students in their learning.                       | In this session you will learn about different resources for teaching Coding, including ‘unplugged’ methods that can be used when you do not have access to a computer lab.                    |
| 6.2.2: Participate in learning to update knowledge and practice, targeted to professional needs and school and/or system priorities. | In this session you will learn about Coding and Computational Thinking can be incorporated into different areas of the curriculum and STEM.                                                    |
| 6.4.2: Undertake professional learning programs designed to address identified student learning needs.                               | In this session you will be introduced to some different tools and approaches for teaching Coding to students with different learning needs (for example, using ScratchJr instead of Scratch). |
