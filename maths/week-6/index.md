# Week 6: Beetle Geometry Part 2

## About

In this session, we will work through Investigation 3 (*Discovering Dots*) and Investigation 4 (*Pen Project: Nature Scenes*) from Module 2: Beetle Geometry, from the ScratchMaths curriculum materials.

The focus of the ScratchMaths Module 2 is the use of Scratch’s pen tool to draw numerals, patterns, polygons and nature scenes. As mentioned in the Module 2 Teacher Materials, the Beetle Geometry activities could also be linked to other learning areas. For example, in Investigation 4 you will draw nature scenes in Scratch, which could be linked to lessons and concepts within HSIE: Geography. 

The **computational concepts** covered in this Module include: *Sequences*, *Operators* and *Loops*. The mathematical concepts that are covered in this Module include: *Shapes* and their *Perimeters*, *Roman Numerals* and *Probability*.

| Estimating and calculating with whole numbers    | In this session’s activities, you will calculate with whole numbers when drawing shapes with Scratch’s pen tool. For example, in the *Dots and Dashes* activity you will use whole numbers to command the Beetle Sprite to draw different letters in Morse code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Recognising and using patterns and relationships | In this session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to recognise and use patterns when drawing circular patterns in Scratch. For example, when you complete the questions in the *Unplugged: Picture Predictions* activity, you will have to recognise that the exterior angles of a circular pattern always add up to 360 degrees and that, consequently, when drawing this pattern, each turn the angle Beetle Sprite makes will be 360 divided by the number of sides in the polygon. |
| Using spatial reasoning                          | In this session’s activities, you will use spatial reasoning when moving Sprites around the Canvas in Scratch. For example, in the *Life’s a Beach* activity, you will move the Beetle Sprite to random positions on the Canvas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Using measurement                                | In this session’s activities, you will use measurement when drawing patterns and scenes with Scratch’s pen tool and reading scripts in the Unplugged activities. For example, in the *Unplugged Assessment: Reading Scripts 2* activity you will reason about the side lengths of different polygons drawn with Scratch’s pen tool.                                                                                                                                                              |

| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions                     | In this session, you will be encouraged to be creative in the activities and to explore a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when creating nature scenes with the pen tool in Scratch.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                            | In this session, you will be encouraged to reflect on your thinking and processes you undertook when completing the activities through the questions in the Class Discussion Points.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures | In this session, you will have the opportunity to synthesise and evaluate the reasoning and procedures you used during the session, through the Class Discussion Points. For example, in the *Life’s a Beach* activity there are questions in these Class Discussion Points that prompt you to explain the processes and strategies used to create these scenes. |

| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)   | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                    |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), events and user input. |
