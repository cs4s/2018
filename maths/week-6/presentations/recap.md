- Last week we did the first two Investigations from Module 2
    - *Exploring Pen* and *Drawing Polygons*
- Calculating angles and using *repeat* to draw polygons
- Created custom blocks for drawing *triangles*, *squares* and *towers*
- Made our Beetle jump to different positions on the Stage

# Module 2: Beetle Geometry

- The *Success Criteria* for Module 2 are on the last page of the [Module 2 Teacher Materials](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wYThHoxBJHoTq2GzUgvsuEQvXPrUxRIW)
- There are 4 Investigations in Module 2
- In this session, we will aim to get the last 2 Investigations completed:
	-  *Discovering Dots* (4 Activities)
	-  *Pen Projects: Nature Scenes* (2 Activities plus 2 Extension Activities)
