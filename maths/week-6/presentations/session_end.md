# Homework Tasks

- Every week we will ask you to complete Homework
- Contributes towards your NESA accreditation hours (each week is 1 hour, for a total of 10 hours)
- After you have finished, please email me and let me know, so I can record this
- The tasks and links to complete this homework will always be available on the session page, under the *Homework* heading

# Week 6 Homework: Nature Scenes

- Create blocks that draw a *Nature Scene* or *Life's a Beach* picture
- There are instructions about how to draw these in the [Teacher Materials](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wYThHoxBJHoTq2GzUgvsuEQvXPrUxRIW)
- Have also included some steps to draw some of the parts of the scene in the *Week 6 Homework Task* document
- Also have a video that shows a scene being drawn - [Nature Scene: A Walk in the Woods Example Video](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1m_Ykfefj12r5DHBAnb7Xh8pv7-lAYAvA)
