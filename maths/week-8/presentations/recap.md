# Last Session

- Started working through ScratchMaths Module 3: *Interacting Sprites*

	- collisions, conversations and Stories
- Also showed the libraries of *Sprites*, *Sounds* and *Backdrops* in Scratch

# Module 3: Interacting Sprites

- Last week we worked on two Investigations from Module 2
    - *Animating Sprites* and *Encountering Conditions*
- We finished the first activity from *Encountering Conditions*: **Repeat Until...**
- Involved using *Conditionals*: repeating actions until a condition was true
- We will delve deeper into using *Conditionals* in today's activities
