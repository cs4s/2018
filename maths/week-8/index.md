# Week 8: Interacting Sprites Part 2

## About

In this session, we will work through the rest of the activities in Investigation 2 (*Encountering Conditions*), Investigation 3 (*Broadcasting Messages*) and Investigation 4 (*Interactive Sprites*), which are from Module 3: Interacting Sprites, from the ScratchMaths Curriculum Materials.

The focus of the ScratchMaths Module 3 is the use of interactions between multiple Sprites in Scratch. These interactions are achieved by using three **computational concepts** - *Conditionals*, *Parallelism* and *Events* - which will be introduced in this Module’s activities. As mentioned in the Module 3 Teacher Materials, the Interacting Sprites activities could also be linked to other key learning areas. For example, in Investigation 4 you will have the opportunity to create an interactive story in Scratch, which could be linked to lessons and concepts within the English syllabus. 

The activities in this Module also build on computational and mathematical concepts from previous Modules, such as: *Probability*, *Sequences*, *Loops*, *Operators* and *Geometry*.

In the *Story of Sprites* activity, you can construct a story that involves elements in those shared stories.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions                             | In this session you will be encouraged to be creative in the activities and to explore a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when creating an interactive story in the *Story of Sprites* activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                                    | In this session you will be encouraged to reflect on your thinking and processes you undertook when completing the activities through the questions in the Class Discussion Points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures         | In this session you will have the opportunity to synthesise and evaluate the reasoning and procedures you used during the session, through the Class Discussion Points. For example, in the *Introductions: One to One* activity there are questions in these Class Discussion Points that prompt you to explain the processes and strategies used to make two Sprites react to another Sprite at the same time. |

| **ACTDIP018:** Design a user interface for a digital system                                                                      | In this session’s activities, you will create a Scratch project that responds to user input (for example, clicking on a Sprite will make that Sprite move around the Stage). |
| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)   | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                                                |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), events and user input.                             |
