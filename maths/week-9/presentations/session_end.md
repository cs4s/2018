# Recap: Exploring Mathematical Relationships

- We started the fifth Module: *Exploring Mathematical Relationships*
- Included learning about:

	- **Computational Concepts:** *Sequences*, *Loops*, *Events* and *Data*
	- **Mathematics Concepts:** *Polygons*, *Co-ordinates* and *Calculating Angles*

# Homework Tasks

- Every week we will ask you to complete Homework
- Contributes towards your NESA accreditation hours (each week is 1 hour, for a total of 10 hours)
- The tasks and links to complete this homework will always be available on the session page, under the *Homework* heading

# Week 9: Create a Lesson Plan

- Plan a lesson that involves the teaching of *Coding* alongside *Mathematics*
- You can complete the template that we have created
- Fill in the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF8FOvcyFbrPOKi_zm2fsv-VCJ5WC4tlxQB5xZu7eSv0wK1A/viewform) or complete and email the Word template on the Week 9 session page
- You can adapt ideas and activities from the *ScratchMaths* modules and investigations (or other resources)

# Lesson Plan Template

- [Google Form Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF8FOvcyFbrPOKi_zm2fsv-VCJ5WC4tlxQB5xZu7eSv0wK1A/viewform)
- The idea of this task is to help you plan out how you could teach Coding in your classes, alongside Mathematics
- You can be brief in your answers to the questions (for example, 2-3 sentences) but you can also write as much as you would like
- Any questions?

# Next Week: The Last Session

- We will: 
    - ask you to complete a survey, similar to the one you completed in Week 1
    - continue with activities from the *Exploring Mathematical Relationships* Module
    - Use *Variables* more
    - Investigate *proportionality* and *ratios* within Scratch
