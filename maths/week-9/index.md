# Week 9: Exploring Mathematical Relationships Part 1

## About

In this session, we will work through Investigation 1 (*Polygon Fireworks Night Skyline*) and the first activity from Investigation 2 (*Mathematically Similar Rectangles*) from Module 5: Exploring Mathematical Relationships, from the ScratchMaths Curriculum Materials.

The focus of the ScratchMaths Module 5 is the exploration of mathematical relationships with Scratch, including proportionality and ratios.
As mentioned in the Module 5 Teacher Materials, the Exploring Mathematical Relationships activities could also be linked to other learning areas.
For example, in Investigation 1 you will have the opportunity to create images that include backdrops of city skylines, which could be linked to lessons and concepts within the HSIE: Geography syllabus. 

This Module also introduces *variables*, which is another **computational concept** and builds on the concepts you have learned in previous sessions, such as *Sequences*, *Loops* and *Operators*.
The activities in the Module also build on mathematical concepts from previous weeks' activities, including *co-ordinates*, *angles*, *division* and *multiplication*.

### Homework

For this week's homework task, we would like you to create a plan for a lesson that involves teaching Coding and Mathematics.
We have created a template for you to complete for this task, which has sections for the different parts of the lesson.
If you would like to, you can use ideas and activities from the ScratchMaths resources in your lesson plan.

To complete this task, you can choose to either: 1) fill in the Google form linked below or 2) download the Word template and email that to Daniel when you have finished filling it in. 
If you complete the Google form, you will not have to send Daniel an email because, once the form is completed, he will be sent an email automatically.

If you use a different template for your lessons and would prefer to use that for this task, that is ok. 
In that case, please send an email with the completed template to Daniel.
