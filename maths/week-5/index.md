# Week 5: Beetle Geometry Part 1

## About

In this session, we will work through Investigation 1 (*Exploring Pen*) and Investigation 2 (*Drawing Polygons*) from Module 2: Beetle Geometry, from the ScratchMaths curriculum materials.

The focus of the ScratchMaths Module 2 is the use of Scratch’s pen tool to draw numerals, patterns, polygons and nature scenes. As mentioned in the Module 2 Teacher Materials, the Beetle Geometry activities could also be linked to other learning areas. For example, in Investigation 4 you will draw nature scenes in Scratch, which could be linked to lessons and concepts within HSIE: Geography. 

The **computational concepts** covered in this Module include: *Sequences*, *Operators* and *Loops*. The mathematical concepts that are covered in this Module include: *Shapes* and their *Perimeters*, *Roman Numerals* and *Probability*.

| Estimating and calculating with whole numbers    | In this session’s activities, you will calculate with whole numbers when drawing shapes with Scratch’s pen tool. For example, in the *Drawing Numerals* activity you will use whole numbers to determine how far the Beetle Sprite moves when it is drawing a numeral.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Recognising and using patterns and relationships | In this session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to recognise and use patterns when drawing shapes in Scratch. For example, when you complete the questions in the *Unplugged: Polygon Scripts* activity, you will have to recognise that the exterior angles of a polygon always add up to 360 degrees and that, consequently, when drawing these shapes, each turn the angle Beetle Sprite makes will be 360 divided by the number of sides in the polygon. |
| Using spatial reasoning                          | In this session’s activities, you will use spatial reasoning when moving Sprites around the Canvas in Scratch. For example, in the *Using and Defining More Blocks* activity, you will move the Beetle Sprite to different positions on the canvas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Using measurement                                | In this session’s activities, you will use measurement when drawing shapes with Scratch’s pen tool and reading scripts in the Unplugged activities. For example, in the *Unplugged: Polygon Scripts* activity you will reason about the side lengths of different polygons.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Reflecting on thinking and processes                            | In this session, you will be encouraged to reflect on your thinking and processes you undertook when completing the activities through the questions in the Class Discussion Points.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures | In this session, you will have the opportunity to synthesise and evaluate the reasoning and procedures you used during the session, through the Class Discussion Points. For example, there are questions in these Class Discussion Points that prompt you to explain the processes and strategies used for drawing shapes in the *Drawing Regular Polygons* activity. |

| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)   | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                    |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), events and user input. |
