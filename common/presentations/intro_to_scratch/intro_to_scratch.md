	- Low floor
	- Wide walls
	- High ceiling
- Free to use
- Moderated community

## Offline vs Online Version

- Online version of Scratch has three main advantages:
	- the Community
	- Teacher Accounts
	- You don't need to install anything on school PCs
- Offline version may be better suited to schools with unreliable or slow internet connections
- We will focus on the online version in this workshop
