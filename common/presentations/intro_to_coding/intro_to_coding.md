##  An Introduction to Coding

- Explain the difference between *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*
- Highlight the main reasons to teach these skills to everyone
- Describe challenges of introducing Coding to K-6
- Introduce a framework for Computational Thinking that we will use during this program

---

## What is Computational Thinking?

- Taking a problem or idea and expressing it in a way that a Computer could follow
- Computers only follow specific and step-by-step instructions (*algorithms*)
- Considered to be a skill that is separate from Coding/Programming

## Reasons for teaching Coding

- Four reasons for teaching Coding to everyone[^1]:
	- Jobs
	- Broadening Participation
	- Computational Literacy
	- Understanding the World

## Reasons for Coding in K-6

- In K-6, the main reasons in our view are:
	- 	*Broadening Participation*
	-  *Computational Literacy*
	-  *Understanding the World*

---

## Coding in the Syllabus

- Science and Technology: Digital Technologies strand:
	- *ST2-2DP-T:* selects and uses materials, tools and equipment to develop solutions for a need or opportunity 
	- *ST2-3DP-T:* defines problems, describes and follows algorithms to develop solutions 
	- *ST2-11DI-T:* describes how digital systems represent and transmit data

---

## Challenges of Bringing Coding to K-6

- Research in this area mainly at a tertiary level[^1]
- Pedagogical content knowledge specific to Coding is relatively new
- Difficult to find time and resources to teach Coding
- Suggestions to integrate Coding into other subjects
- How does this integration work in practice and do students benefit?

---

## Computational Thinking Framework

- Different organisations and researchers define CT in many different ways
- Brennan and Resnick defined a framework with three dimensions[^2] based students creating Scratch projects
	- *Computational concepts*
	- *Computational practices*
	- *Computational perspectives*

## Computational Concepts

- "the concepts designers employ as they program":
	- *Sequences*
	- *Loops*
	- *Events*
	- *Parallelism*
	- *Conditionals*
	- *Data*

---

## Computational Practices

- "the practices designers develop as they program":
	- *Being Incremental and Iterative*
	- *Testing and Debugging*
	- *Reusing and Remixing*
	- *Abstracting and Modularizing*

---

## Computational Perspectives

- "the perspectives designers form about the world around them and about themselves":
	- *Expressing*
	- *Connecting*
	- *Questioning*

## Learning Computational Thinking (CT)

- You will learn about the different *concepts*, *practices* and *perspectives* in the coming weeks
- Activities will be in *Scratch* and *Visual Programming* 
- These *concepts*, *practices* and *perspectives* are relevant to any Coding environment/language
- We will also include *"unplugged"* approaches for CT
- *Scratch* is a powerful tool - not only for Coding but designing and creating as well
