# Week 10: Coding and Science and Technology Part 2

## About

In the Week 9 and 10 sessions, you will learn about what *Physical Computing* is and how projects that incorporate *Physical Computing* can be linked to outcomes in the new *Science and Technology K-6* syllabus. 
The focus of the activities will be on the *Technology* outcomes but we hope to demonstrate that the use of *Physical Computing* in projects can help students learn and reinforce concepts from a variety of *Key Learning Areas*.

As this session is the last session in the Coding in Stage 3: Coding & STEAM program, we will also ask you to complete an online survey. 
This survey is similar to the one that we asked you to complete in the Week 1 session but it also has some extra questions where you can give us feedback about the program. 
We will also let you know about Stage 2 of the project and tell you how you can be involved with the interviews and/or observations in Term 3 and 4.

*Physical Computing* usually refers to designing and developing computer hardware and software that involves some physical interaction or the use of sensors. 
This physical interaction could be a different way of interacting with the computer, which may not involve using a mouse and keyboard. 
In this session, we will focus on alternative forms of physical interaction, such as *Video Sensing* in *Scratch* and programs created in *MakeCode* that respond to pressing a button on, or shaking, a device (a *Micro:bit*).

There are a variety of devices that are used for teaching *Physical Computing* in schools. 
Examples of these devices include [Makey Makeys](https://makeymakey.com/){: target="_blank" }, [LEGO WeDo](https://education.lego.com/en-us/elementary/shop/wedo-2){: target="_blank" } and [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/){: target="_blank" }. The increased availability and affordability of these devices has helped spur on the ["Maker Movement"](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28408/maker-movement){: target="_blank" }. This is encouraging for **STEAM** (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **A**rts and **M**athematics) education, because being a *Maker* usually involves using skills from all of these disciplines to create a real, tangible invention.

This [guitar created with a MaKey MaKey and Scratch](https://arraywhiz52446.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/k-2-makey-makey-project-part-i/){: target="_blank" } is an example of a **STEAM** project that could be created by Stage 3 students with a *Physical Computing* device. This project involves:

- **Science:** students would have to build a circuit as part of the project, which will connect the different guitar strings to the *MaKey MaKey*.
- **Technology:** students would write code in *Scratch* that would play notes when different keys are pressed.
- **Engineering:** students would design and prototype a product (the guitar).
- **Arts:** students would use different musical notes play in their *Scratch* project and could create compositions with the guitar they make.
- **Mathematics:** students would use whole numbers when learning about musical notes that are represented in MIDI and they may also learn about the relationship between MIDI notes and their pitch (for example, the higher the number for a MIDI note is, the higher its pitch will be).

In this session, you will learn about two ways of using *Physical Computing*: *Video Sensing* in *Scratch* and using [BBC Micro:bits](http://microbit.org/){: target="_blank" } devices.

### Homework

For this week's homework task, we would like you to create another plan for a lesson that involves teaching Coding.
You can integrate Coding with another Key Learning Area in your lesson, such as English or the Creative Arts, or focus only on Coding.
We have created a template for you to complete for this task, which has sections for the different parts of the lesson.
If you would like to, you can use ideas and activities from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide in your lesson plan.

To complete this task, you can choose to either: 1) fill in the Google form linked below or 2) download the Word template and email that to Daniel when you have finished filling it in.
If you complete the Google form, you will not have to send Daniel an email because, once the form is completed, he will be sent an email automatically.

If you use a different template for your lessons and would prefer to use that for this task, that is ok. 
In that case, please send an email with the completed template to Daniel.

| Inquiring â€“ identifying, exploring and organising information and ideas | In this session, you will learn about how *Micro:bits* (and similar *Physical Computing* devices) can be used as part of scientific experiments. If you ran a project in which your students planned and conducted a scientific experiment, they could use the *Micro:bits'* sensors to collect data related to the subject of the inquiry. |

| **ACTDIP016:** Examine the main components of common digital systems and how they may connect together to form networks to transmit data | In this session, you will learn about a few different ways that data can be transmitted between devices. For example, when using the *Micro:bit* devices, you will learn about transferring .hex files onto the devices, which will cause the *Micro:bit* to follow the algorithms coded in *MakeCode*.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **ACTDIP017:** Define problems in terms of data and functional requirements drawing on previously solved problems                        | In this session, you will learn about activities within the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* that can help you run open-ended projects involving Coding. These open-ended projects often involve defining problems in terms of data and identifying functional requirements. For example, in the activities from *Unit 5 (Hackathon)*, students are encouraged to choose their own problem to address and create a digital solution to this problem. |
| **ACTDIP018:** Design a user interface for a digital system                                                                              | In this sessionâ€™s activities, you will have the opportunity to design and develop alternative user interfaces with *Physical Computing* devices and tools. For example, in the *Video Sensing* activity you will create a *Scratch* project that responds to motion captured by a computer's webcam.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)           | In this sessionâ€™s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow) in both *Scratch* and *MakeCode*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input         | In this session, you will implement programs in *Scratch* and *MakeCode* that include loops (iteration), branching, events and user input.  *Scratch* is an example of a *Visual Programming Language* and *MakeCode* is an example of a *Hybrid Coding Environment* (an environment that combines *Visual Programming* and *General-Purpose Programming*).                                                                                               |
