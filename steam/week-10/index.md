# Week 10: Coding and Science and Technology Part 2

## About

In the Week 9 and 10 sessions, you will learn about what *Physical Computing* is and how projects that incorporate *Physical Computing* can be linked to outcomes in the new *Science and Technology K-6* syllabus. 
The focus of the activities will be on the *Technology* outcomes but we hope to demonstrate that the use of *Physical Computing* in projects can help students learn and reinforce concepts from a variety of *Key Learning Areas*.

*Physical Computing* usually refers to designing and developing computer hardware and software that involves some physical interaction or the use of sensors. 
This physical interaction could be a different way of interacting with the computer, which may not involve using a mouse and keyboard. 
In this session, we will focus on alternative forms of physical interaction, such as *Video Sensing* in *Scratch* and programs created in *MakeCode* that respond to pressing a button on, or shaking, a device (a *Micro:bit*).

There are a variety of devices that are used for teaching *Physical Computing* in schools. 
Examples of these devices include [Makey Makeys](https://makeymakey.com/){: target="_blank" }, [LEGO WeDo](https://education.lego.com/en-us/elementary/shop/wedo-2){: target="_blank" } and [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/){: target="_blank" }. The increased availability and affordability of these devices has helped spur on the ["Maker Movement"](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28408/maker-movement){: target="_blank" }. This is encouraging for **STEAM** (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **A**rts and **M**athematics) education, because being a *Maker* usually involves using skills from all of these disciplines to create a real, tangible invention.

This [guitar created with a MaKey MaKey and Scratch](https://arraywhiz52446.wordpress.com/2015/05/28/k-2-makey-makey-project-part-i/){: target="_blank" } is an example of a **STEAM** project that could be created by Stage 3 students with a *Physical Computing* device. This project involves:

- **Science:** students would have to build a circuit as part of the project, which will connect the different guitar strings to the *MaKey MaKey*.
- **Technology:** students would write code in *Scratch* that would play notes when different keys are pressed.
- **Engineering:** students would design and prototype a product (the guitar).
- **Arts:** students would use different musical notes play in their *Scratch* project and could create compositions with the guitar they make.
- **Mathematics:** students would use whole numbers when learning about musical notes that are represented in MIDI and they may also learn about the relationship between MIDI notes and their pitch (for example, the higher the number for a MIDI note is, the higher its pitch will be).

In this session, you will learn about two ways of using *Physical Computing*: *Video Sensing* in *Scratch* and using [BBC Micro:bits](http://microbit.org/){: target="_blank" } devices.

### Homework

For this week's homework task, we would like you to create another plan for a lesson that involves teaching Coding.
You can integrate Coding with another Key Learning Area in your lesson, such as English or the Creative Arts, or focus only on Coding.
We have created a template for you to complete for this task, which has sections for the different parts of the lesson.
If you would like to, you can use ideas and activities from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide in your lesson plan.

To complete this task, you can choose to either: 1) fill in the Google form linked below or 2) download the Word template and email that to Daniel when you have finished filling it in.
If you complete the Google form, you will not have to send Daniel an email because, once the form is completed, he will be sent an email automatically.

If you use a different template for your lessons and would prefer to use that for this task, that is ok. 
In that case, please send an email with the completed template to Daniel.
