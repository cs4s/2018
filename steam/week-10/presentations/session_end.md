# Homework Tasks

- Every week we will ask you to complete Homework
- Contributes towards your NESA accreditation hours (each week is 1 hour, for a total of 10 hours)

# Week 10: Create another Lesson Plan

- Plan another lesson that involves the teaching of *Coding* (+ a Key Learning Area, e.g. *English*, if you would like)
- You can complete the template that we have created
- Fill in the [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/fom7rrTiAk39NVR52) or complete and email the Word template on the Week 10 session page

# Lesson Plan Template

- [Google Form Template](https://goo.gl/forms/fom7rrTiAk39NVR52)
- The idea of this task is to help you plan out how you could teach Coding in your classes
- You can be brief in your answers to the questions (for example, 2-3 sentences) but you can also write as much as you would like
- Any questions?
