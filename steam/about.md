## About the Program

The *Coding in Stage 3* program is a professional learning program for Stage 3 teachers that has been developed by researchers at the University of Newcastle, Australia. The program is part of [Mr Daniel Hickmott's](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/daniel-hickmott-uon){: target="_blank" } PhD project, which investigates how Stage 3 teachers in New South Wales learn and teach Coding and Computational Thinking. The information statement that explains how the program is situated within the PhD project is [available online here](https://cs4s.github.io/docs/coding_for_primary_pl_stage1_information_statement.pdf){: target="_blank" }.

The *ScratchMaths* stream of the *Coding in Stage 3* program uses resources that have been adapted from the [ScratchMaths curriculum materials](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/projects/scratchmaths/curriculum-materials){: target="_blank" }, which were created by researchers at University College London. The focus of the *ScratchMaths* stream of the *Coding in Stage 3* program is the teaching of Coding and Computational Thinking alongside [Stage 3 Mathematics](https://syllabus.nesa.nsw.edu.au/mathematics/mathematics-k10/){: target="_blank" }.  All of the sessions' activities in the program have been mapped to the relevant Stage 3 syllabus outcomes, AITSL Teacher Standards, ACARA General Capabilities and ACARA Digital Technologies content descriptors.

## About the Website

The purpose of this website is to assist in the running of the weekly, face-to-face tutorial sessions during the *Coding in Stage 3* program, by giving participating teachers one place to find all of the program resources and a record of how the different activities in the program address relevant learning outcomes. The adapted materials and original content are licenced under a Creative Commons licence and, consequently, can be used and remixed for non-commercial purposes. If you do use or remix these materials, or have any questions about using them in your professional learning programs, please reach out and let [Daniel know through email](mailto:daniel.hickmott@uon.edu.au?subject=Coding%20in%20Stage%203%20Materials).
