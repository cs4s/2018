# Week 1: An Introduction to Scratch

## About

In this session, we will give an overview of the entire professional learning program. We will also explain the research project that this program is a part of.

In the session’s activities, you will find out what *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* are and how these skills are related to the Stage 3 curriculum. You will learn about Scratch, the free coding language and community that is commonly used when teaching computational thinking in K-6. You will create a program that combines three essential **computational concepts**: *sequences*, *loops* and *conditionals*.

We will discuss potential ethical issues of remixing, particularly plagiarism, and how to address this.                                                              |
| 6.2.2: Participate in learning to update knowledge and practice, targeted to professional needs and school and/or system priorities. | In this session, you will learn about Coding and Computational Thinking can be incorporated into different areas of the curriculum and STEM.                                                                                                              |

Some of these teaching approaches could be more suitable to students with particular learning needs (for example, teaching students Coding in pairs, rather than individually). |
