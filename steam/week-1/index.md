title: Coding in Stage 3 - Coding & STEAM - Week 1
---

# Week 1: An Introduction to Scratch

## About

In this session, we will give an overview of the entire Professional Learning program. We will also explain the research project that this program is a part of.

In this sessionâ€™s activities, you will find out what *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* are and the main reasons why these skills are being introduced into K-6.  You will learn about *Scratch*, the free *Coding* language and community that is commonly used when teaching *Computational Thinking* in K-6. You will also create a program in *Scratch* that combines three essential **computational concepts**: *sequences*, *loops* and *conditionals*.
