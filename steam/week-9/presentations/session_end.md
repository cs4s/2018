# Recap: Coding and Science and Technology

- We started learning about *Physical Computing* with *Video Sensing in Scratch* and *Micro:bits*
- Activities that have links to *Science and Technology*
- Particularly the design and development of projects
- Could be used for projects incorporating *STEAM* (*S*cience, *T*echnology, *E*ngineering, *A*rts and *M*athematics)

---

# Homework Tasks

- Every week we will ask you to complete Homework
- Contributes towards your NESA accreditation hours (each week is 1 hour, for a total of 10 hours)
- The tasks and links to complete this homework will always be available on the session page, under the *Homework* heading

# Week 9: Create a Lesson Plan

- Plan a lesson that involves the teaching of *Coding* (+ a Key Learning Area, e.g. *English*, if you would like)
- You can complete the template that we have created
- Fill in the [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/fom7rrTiAk39NVR52) or complete and email the Word template on the Week 9 session page
- You can adapt ideas and activities from the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* (or other resources)

# Lesson Plan Template

- [Google Form Template](https://goo.gl/forms/fom7rrTiAk39NVR52)
- The idea of this task is to help you plan out how you could teach Coding in your classes
- You can be brief in your answers to the questions (for example, 2-3 sentences) but you can also write as much as you would like
- Any questions?

# Next Week: The Last Session

- We will: 
    - ask you to complete a survey, similar to the one you completed in Week 1
    - continue with activities with *Micro:bit* devices
    - learn about how to use *sensors* and collect *Data* with *Micro:bits*

# Journal

- Please complete a Journal entry before you leave today (should take 5-10 minutes)
- Link to Weekly Journal survey is on the session page, under the *Links* heading
- Or go to [hckmd.com/journal](hckmd.com/journal)
