# Week 9: Coding and Science and Technology Part 1

## About

In the Coding and Mathematics sessions, you will learn how the creation of games in Scratch can be linked to the teaching of Mathematics concepts.  

The sessionâ€™s activities have been adapted from Unit 4 (Games) of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. 
The activities in Unit 4 are intended to encourage students to develop Scratch projects are personally relevant and meaningful to them. 
The authors of the guide argue that this personal relevance and meaning will help students persevere when they encounter challenging problems when Coding in Scratch.

In the Part 2 session, we will focus on two activities from Unit 4 of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide: *Debug It!* and *Interactions*.

### Homework

For this week's homework task, we would like you to create a plan for a lesson that involves teaching Coding.
You can integrate Coding with another Key Learning Area in your lesson, such as English or the Creative Arts, or focus only on Coding.
We have created a template for you to complete for this task, which has sections for the different parts of the lesson.
If you would like to, you can use ideas and activities from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide in your lesson plan.

To complete this task, you can choose to either: 1) fill in the Google form linked below or 2) download the Word template and email that to Daniel when you have finished filling it in.
If you complete the Google form, you will not have to send Daniel an email because, once the form is completed, he will be sent an email automatically.

If you use a different template for your lessons and would prefer to use that for this task, that is ok. 
In that case, please send an email with the completed template to Daniel.
