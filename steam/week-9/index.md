# Week 9: Coding and Science and Technology Part 1

## About

In the Coding and Mathematics sessions, you will learn how the creation of games in Scratch can be linked to the teaching of Mathematics concepts.  

The session’s activities have been adapted from Unit 4 (Games) of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. 
The activities in Unit 4 are intended to encourage students to develop Scratch projects are personally relevant and meaningful to them. 
The authors of the guide argue that this personal relevance and meaning will help students persevere when they encounter challenging problems when Coding in Scratch.

In the Part 2 session, we will focus on two activities from Unit 4 of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide: *Debug It!* and *Interactions*.

### Homework

For this week's homework task, we would like you to create a plan for a lesson that involves teaching Coding.
You can integrate Coding with another Key Learning Area in your lesson, such as English or the Creative Arts, or focus only on Coding.
We have created a template for you to complete for this task, which has sections for the different parts of the lesson.
If you would like to, you can use ideas and activities from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide in your lesson plan.

To complete this task, you can choose to either: 1) fill in the Google form linked below or 2) download the Word template and email that to Daniel when you have finished filling it in.
If you complete the Google form, you will not have to send Daniel an email because, once the form is completed, he will be sent an email automatically.

If you use a different template for your lessons and would prefer to use that for this task, that is ok. 
In that case, please send an email with the completed template to Daniel.

| **ACTDIP016:** Examine the main components of common digital systems and how they may connect together to form networks to transmit data | In this session, you will learn about a few different ways that data can be transmitted between devices. For example, when using the *Micro:bit* devices, you will learn about transferring .hex files onto the devices, which will cause the *Micro:bit* to follow the algorithms coded in *MakeCode*.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **ACTDIP017:** Define problems in terms of data and functional requirements drawing on previously solved problems                        | In this session, you will learn about activities within the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* that can help you run open-ended projects involving Coding. These open-ended projects often involve defining problems in terms of data and identifying functional requirements. For example, in the activities from *Unit 5 (Hackathon)*, students are encouraged to choose their own problem to address and create a digital solution to this problem. |
| **ACTDIP018:** Design a user interface for a digital system                                                                              | In this session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to design and develop alternative user interfaces with *Physical Computing* devices and tools. For example, in the *Video Sensing* activity you will create a *Scratch* project that responds to motion captured by a computer's webcam.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)           | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow) in both *Scratch* and *MakeCode*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input         | In this session, you will implement programs in *Scratch* and *MakeCode* that include loops (iteration), branching, events and user input.  *Scratch* is an example of a *Visual Programming Language* and *MakeCode* is an example of a *Hybrid Coding Environment* (an environment that combines *Visual Programming* and *General-Purpose Programming*).                                                                                               |
