# Week 2: Teaching Coding with Scratch

## About

In this session, we will explain a few different approaches for teaching and assessing *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*, with a focus on approaches for teaching these skills with *Scratch*.

In the session’s activities, you will learn how to use *Scratch Teacher Accounts*, which are a special type of *Scratch* accounts that can help you manage your students’ projects. You will also learn about remixing projects in *Scratch* and how remixing can be used with *Scratch Teacher Accounts* to run activities with your students.
